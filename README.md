# fullstack-order-webapp

## Project Overview:
This is a full-stack web application simulating an online flower shop. Customers can place orders by filling out an order form, update shipping information, and track the status of their orders in real-time. Orders are stored in a MySQL database and tracked in real-time. Customers have a limited time window (one minute and thirty seconds) displayed on screen to update their shipping information or cancel their order before it is shipped. 

The project also includes an admin page where admins can search and filter orders by customer name and order status.
